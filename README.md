# Snake Game Project
Description:  
This is a project I created to rebuild the classic Snake Game, using turtle. I enhanced the game by adding a new feature where every time a new food appears it has a different colour, and after the snake eats it, the snake will turn into that colour too.
## Getting Started
The project doesn't need any additonal package installation. You can either use your local Python interpreter or create a new venv for this project. To run it, go to 'main.py', and run the file.
